# Pittsburgh-Housing-Prices-Analysis
This is a project that uses regression analysis to find the most expensive neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. The deliverable of this project was a powerpoint presentation. The PDF above contains the slides.

In the repository is my work in R and Python. 
- Python was used to complete the data cleaning process. 
- R was used to run two regressions. The two regressions used here are orthogonal polynomial regression and multiple linear regression.
